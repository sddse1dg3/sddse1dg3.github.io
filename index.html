            <h3>Types of Cyberbullying</h3>
            <p>Cyberbullying can take various forms, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Internet Text</h4>
                    <p>This includes discriminatory jokes, cruel criticism, embarrassing online voting, and other forms of harsh and hurtful language. Such behavior can lead to negative psychological development, particularly affecting teenagers who may be more susceptible to the influence of others' words and actions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Image and Video Harassment</h4>
                    <p>This involves the circulation of private photos, receiving sexually suggestive pictures or videos from others, and the modification and widespread circulation of photos. Often, fake images or videos include personal information such as names and contact information, causing significant harm to the victim's reputation and leading to further harassment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Personal Messages</h4>
                    <p>This type of cyberbullying involves sending uncomfortable images or text containing threats, sexual innuendos, and other harmful content directly to the victim using email, mobile phone messages, or other digital communication platforms. Personal messages may combine elements of text and image harassment, making the victim more defensive and causing severe mental harm.</p>
